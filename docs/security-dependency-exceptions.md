# Security dependency exceptions

## Metro `image-size` denial of service advisories

As of 2026-08-12, `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reports GHSA-w3rx-r6r6-pgpr and GHSA-5p2g-fcmc-qvqq through Expo/Metro's transitive `image-size` dependency. The registry offers no non-breaking patched dependency chain; the suggested forced fix downgrades React Native from 0.86 to 0.72 and is not compatible with this Expo SDK.

Exposure is limited to developer/build-time processing of repository assets. Production clients do not invoke Metro or parse user uploads with `image-size`. Until Expo/Metro ships a patched chain, do not add untrusted ICNS, JXL, HEIF, or HEIC files to the repository or build context. Re-run the audit on every dependency update and remove this exception as soon as a compatible patched release is available.

## Prisma `deepmerge-ts` stack exhaustion advisory

As of 2026-08-18, `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` also reports GHSA-ggr8-5vv4-36mx (stack exhaustion when merging recursive object graphs) through `prisma@6.19.x`'s transitive `@prisma/config` -> `deepmerge-ts@7.1.5` dependency. The suggested fix (`prisma@6.12.0`) is a downgrade from the version this repo currently depends on, not a forward patch, and is not something we want to take.

Exposure is limited to `prisma generate`/`prisma migrate`/config-loading at build and migration time — `deepmerge-ts` merges the Prisma config object graph, not any request-time or user-controlled data, and the API server does not import `@prisma/config` at runtime. Re-run the audit on every Prisma upgrade and remove this exception once a `prisma` release depends on a patched `deepmerge-ts` (>=8.0.0).

## Nest `multer` (no patched release)

`@nestjs/platform-express` pulls `multer`. No route in this API uses `FileInterceptor` or multipart upload; document and image bodies are JSON base64. Until Nest ships a patched `multer`, the API production audit may still report it. Re-evaluate on every Nest upgrade.
