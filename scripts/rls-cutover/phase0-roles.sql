-- RLS cutover — Phase 0: provision database principals (one-time, as SUPERUSER).
--
-- Run this ONCE per environment against the target database, connected as a
-- superuser (or the Supabase `postgres` role). It is idempotent. It does NOT
-- switch the application over — the API keeps using its current role until you
-- change DATABASE_URL (see phase-final-cutover notes in rls-cutover-runbook.md).
--
-- Roles:
--   stadium_migrator — schema owner used ONLY by release/migration jobs (CI /
--                      Cloud Run Job), never by the API image.
--   stadium_api      — API runtime role: LOGIN, NOBYPASSRLS, no DDL. Tenant
--                      isolation is enforced against THIS role by the policies
--                      in migrations 20260903120000 / 20260903130000.
--
-- Set the two psql variables before running, e.g.:
--   psql "$DATABASE_DIRECT_URL" \
--     -v db_name="$(psql "$DATABASE_DIRECT_URL" -tAc 'select current_database()')" \
--     -v stadium_api_password="'<STRONG-SECRET>'" \
--     -f scripts/rls-cutover/phase0-roles.sql
-- The password value must be quoted (it is injected as a SQL literal).

-- app_private was explicitly locked down to PUBLIC (REVOKE ALL ... FROM

-- DEFINER function's body calling ANOTHER function in the same schema (e.g.
-- venue_matches() calling current_venue_id()) still needs the schema-level
-- USAGE grant for whichever role it's executing as, regardless of ownership.
-- Verified locally: every stadium_api call into venue_matches() failed with

-- Reassign ownership of every EXISTING table/sequence/function to
-- stadium_migrator. This is not optional: PostgreSQL exempts a table's OWNER
-- from RLS whenever the table isn't FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY, and the
-- auth-bootstrap SECURITY
-- DEFINER functions (migration 20260903140000) rely on exactly that exemption
-- to read Session/User/Profile/Venue before any tenant GUC can exist. On a
-- database whose tables predate this script (i.e. every real deploy so far,
-- created under whatever the deploy credential was — typically `postgres`),
-- those functions would otherwise hit `permission denied for table X` the
-- first time this migrator role differs from the table's actual owner.
-- Verified locally: this failed exactly this way until ownership was
-- reassigned. Idempotent — reassigning an already-stadium_migrator-owned
-- object is a no-op.
--
-- IMPORTANT: owner-exemption is therefore a load-bearing part of the bootstrap,
-- which means FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY must never be applied to a table that an
-- app_private SECURITY DEFINER helper reads. Some tables ARE forced (the
-- stadium/VMS/enterprise set), and that is fine because no helper touches them.
-- The tables that must stay un-forced are Profile, Venue, Role, Session,
-- OrganizationMembership, ScopeAssignment, DepartmentAreaRule,
-- DepartmentMembership and UserAreaOverride — "Profile" above all, since
-- app_private.venue_matches() reads it and roughly 88 tenant policies call
-- venue_matches(). Migration 20260917130000 encodes this carve-out and asserts
-- it, so the invariant is checked rather than remembered.
